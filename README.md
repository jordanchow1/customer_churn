# Customer Churn Prediction

This project demonstrates an end-to-end workflow for predicting customer churn using Python and machine learning techniques. It covers data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, model building, and evaluation to generate actionable insights for reducing churn.

## Key Features

- **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:** Handle missing values, encode categorical variables, scale features, and prepare datasets for modeling.  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualize patterns and trends in customer behavior to uncover insights.  
- **Feature Engineering:** Create meaningful features to improve model accuracy and interpretability.  
- **Modeling:** Implement machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting.  
- **Evaluation & Interpretation:** Assess model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.  
- **Actionable Insights:** Identify high-risk churn customer segments and suggest targeted retention strategies.

## Tools

- **Languages:** Python  
- **Libraries:** pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn  
- **Techniques:** Classification, Feature Engineering, Data Visualization, Model Evaluation
